			<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Show me a software company whose products reflect the culture, talent, and personality of its staff and I will show you SPARC. SPARC is a software company creating...engagement! We create it around the office AND in the products that we bring to market. As part of SPARC’s “Get ‘em in and keep ‘em in” philosophy, SPARCIN, SPARCET, and SPARC’D allow companies to hire the right people and keep them performing at a high level through engagement. SPARCIN is an interview management tool using crowdsourcing to help every part of the interview process. Once in the door, SPARCET is used for peer-to-peer recognition and SPARC’D to continually engage employees over time. SPARC’s engagement culture is also prevalent in SPARC520, our green energy analysis and strategy platform. With physical inputs from both buildings and staff, SPARC520 uses real-time data from SPARCIQ, our robust analytics engine, to efficiently run facilities. We even have Knappsack, our free open-source Mobile Application Management (MAM) platform, featuring secure deployment and full life-cycle management of mobile apps. Many of these products came from SPARC Ventures, an internal program encouraging innovation, collaboration, and entreprenuership. When you have a team that is highly engaged, their vision, energy, talent can create amazing products - products that reflect the people that made them! </Data></Cell>
